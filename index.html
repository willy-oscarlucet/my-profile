        <h2>National level of Surfing </h2>
        <p>When I was young, more precisely in middle school, I ranked 3rd at the French surf championships (teams). It confirmed my leadership skills and my enjoyement for teamwork.

        <h2>Humanitarian Experience</h2>
        <p>With my mother and brother, when we were young, we accompanied her to Kenya to help her to build a school for the Maasai. We taught them the basics of French and gave them food and supplies to live (clothes, books, notebooks, pen...). It was a very enriching experience that opened me up to the world and made me want to help those in need.
